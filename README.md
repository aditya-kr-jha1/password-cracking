Password Cracking (Educational Project)

Overview
This repository is an educational project created to understand how password hashing and cracking work using Hashcat.
It demonstrates dictionary-based attacks on sample password hashes in a legal and ethical learning environment.

This project is strictly for educational purposes only.
Do NOT use these techniques on real systems or passwords without explicit permission.

Objectives
Understand what password hashes are
Learn how dictionary attacks work
Use Hashcat to crack self-generated sample hashes
Practice basic cybersecurity concepts responsibly

Tools Used
Hashcat (Password recovery tool)
Windows PowerShell / Command Prompt
MD5 hash algorithm (for demonstration)

 Repository Structure
password-cracking/
│
├── README.md          → Project documentation
├── hash.txt           → Contains sample password hash
├── wordlist.txt       → Dictionary used for cracking
├── password.txt       → Dummy passwords (for learning only)


 Note:
All passwords and hashes in this repository are dummy and self-created, not real user data.

 How It Works
1️⃣ Generate a Hash (Example)

Example password:

india123


Its MD5 hash:

8d763385e0476c5f29c6b4e45d2d8f8d


Stored in hash.txt

2️⃣ Prepare Wordlist

wordlist.txt contains possible password guesses, for example:

india
india123
password
admin
123456

3️ Run Hashcat Command
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt


Where:

-m 0 → MD5 hash mode

-a 0 → Dictionary attack

4️ Show Cracked Password
hashcat -m 0 --show hash.txt

 Learning Outcomes

Difference between plain text passwords and hashed passwords

Why weak passwords are dangerous

Importance of strong password policies

Ethical use of cybersecurity tools

 Ethical Disclaimer

This repository is intended only for learning and academic purposes.

❌ Do NOT:
Crack real user passwords
