# Password Cracking and Hashing Algorithms

##  Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **password hashing and password cracking techniques** using industry-standard tools.  
The objective is to understand how weak passwords can be compromised and why strong hashing and security practices are essential.

This is a **learning-oriented cybersecurity project** created for educational and internship evaluation purposes.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand how password hashing works
- Learn different password cracking techniques
- Use professional tools like **Hashcat**
- Analyze the importance of strong passwords and hashing algorithms
- Practice ethical cybersecurity methodologies

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Hashcat** (Password recovery tool)
- **Wordlists** (for dictionary attacks)
- **Windows OS**
- **Command Line / PowerShell**
- Basic knowledge of **hashing algorithms** (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
