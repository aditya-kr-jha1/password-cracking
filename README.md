# Password Cracking and Hashing Algorithms  
*(Educational Cybersecurity Project)*

## Overview
This project demonstrates how weak passwords can be compromised when password hashes are exposed, and why secure hashing practices are essential.  
The project is strictly **educational** and performed in a **controlled environment** using self-generated data.

---

## Objective
- To understand how passwords are stored using hashing algorithms  
- To demonstrate dictionary and brute-force (mask) attacks on weak password hashes  
- To analyze the importance of strong passwords and secure hashing  

---

## Tool Used
### Hashcat  
Hashcat is used as an external password-cracking tool for performing offline attacks on hashed passwords.

> Hashcat is **not included** in this repository.  
> Users must install Hashcat separately from the official website.

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is created **only for academic and learning purposes**.  
All password hashes used are **self-generated**.  
No real user data, systems, or accounts were accessed.
